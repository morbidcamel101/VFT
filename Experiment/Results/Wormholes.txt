Hypothesis: A phase of 0.5 with 20 qubits and no spin might alter the v-boson activity noticeably.
===============================================
Parameters for the current run:
Number of qubits (n): 20
Number of runs: 100
Use Spin: False
Phase: 0.5
Number of layers: 1
Verbose mode: False
===============================================
Average number of Ones over 100 runs: 9.91 with standard deviation: 2.249866662715816. This indicates the average 'density' or 'population' of v-bosons in the quantum vacuum.
Average number of correlated neighboring qubit pairs over 100 runs: 9.44 with standard deviation: 2.3508296407864187. This suggests the interactions or correlations between v-bosons in the quantum vacuum.

--------------------------------------------Running Experiment #37...
Hypothesis: A phase of 0.5 with 20 qubits and spin could lead to distinct v-boson interactions.
===============================================
Parameters for the current run:
Number of qubits (n): 20
Number of runs: 100
Use Spin: True
Phase: 0.5
Number of layers: 1
Verbose mode: False
===============================================
Average number of Ones over 100 runs: 10.34 with standard deviation: 2.0553345226507522. This indicates the average 'density' or 'population' of v-bosons in the quantum vacuum.
Average number of correlated neighboring qubit pairs over 100 runs: 9.37 with standard deviation: 2.184742547761635. This suggests the interactions or correlations between v-bosons in the quantum vacuum.
The higher than expected average number of Ones suggests a more 'active' vacuum with increased v-boson activity.
